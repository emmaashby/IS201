                    <h4>Mendon Food Stand - Mendon, UT</h4>
                    <h4>Summer of 2022</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the small town that I grew up in, there is a local food stand, I undertook the job of running it this past summer. This consisted of creating a menu, designing the transaction program and timecards, developing a work schedule, and hiring employees. I managed our inventory and did most of the supply orders. Also, I trained the employees and worked with them almost every shift.</li> 
                            <li>This job was not olny fun but it also taught me a lot about being a leader and managing a buiness. When aspects went wrong, I was the one who had to fix them. I also had to deal with unhappy customers, and think under pressure when something broke or we ran out of food. I learned a lot about customer managment, working under pressure, and finding joy in my work. It was a memerable summer and taught me lessons I will never forget.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>During the school year my senior, junior, and part of my sophomore years of high school I worked part-time as a custodial cleaner. This involved cleaning and vacuuming the carpets of the elementary as well as cleaning the windows every night. I was responsible for making sure all the doors in my hall were locked and making sure the school was clean and ready for the students in the morning.</li>
                                <li>The summer after my senior year I worked as part of the deep cleaning crew. I worked 6-8 hours a day, Monday through Friday. This involved stripping the tile and refinishing it, deep cleaning the bathrooms and toilets, carpet cleaning, cleaning off the roof, cleaning all inside and outside windows, and sanitizing all the school equipment so it was ready for the incoming students.</li>

                    <h4>2017 - 2022</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mingos is a family business that I helped my mother to create. We build it from the ground up (literally). It is a soda shop where we make mixed drinks and treats. I manage the design aspect of the business; I designed the menu and created our t-shirts. I also run our social media page and performed all the advertising. I do the photography for our posts and create the new drinks for the week, along with assisting in inventory. My mother and I have ran this buisness summer after summer and have enjoyed learning about being an entrepreneur.</li>
